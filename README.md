## How to Add a New App Feedback Page

1. **Add the app to `js/content.js`**:
   ```javascript
   // In the apps array:
   {
       id: 'myapp',           // URL slug (myapp/ folder)
       name: 'MyApp',         // Display name
       tagline: 'Your app description'
   }
   ```

2. **Create a folder** with the app id (e.g., `myapp/`)

3. **Copy an existing page** (e.g., `todoguard/index.html`) into the new folder

4. **Update only these items**:
   - `<title>` tag to "MyApp App Support"
   - `<meta name="description">` with your app description
   - `data-app-id` attribute on `<body>` to `"myapp"`

5. **(Optional)** Add a `privacy.html` file if needed

That's it! All other content (labels, intro text, etc.) is loaded dynamically from `content.js`.

## Spam Prevention Configuration

The form includes client-side rate limiting to prevent abuse:

**File**: `js/feedback.js`

```javascript
var COOLDOWN_HOURS = 24;           // Hours between submissions
var MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_DAY = 3;   // Max submissions per day
```

These settings are stored in `localStorage` and prevent excessive submissions from the same browser.

## Using as App Store Support URL

In **App Store Connect**:

1. Go to your app → **App Information**
2. Under **Support URL**, enter your feedback page URL:
   - `https://justjais.github.io/apps_feedback/index.html`
3. This URL will appear on your App Store listing

## Design Reference

All styling is based on the specifications in `content/Contact_page.md`. Key design elements:

- **Font**: Poppins (Google Fonts)
- **Primary Color**: `#1abc9c` (teal)
- **Layout**: Two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile
- **Form Style**: Clean inputs with focus states and dashed-border submit button

## Privacy

This website:
- Does **not** collect or store any personal data on this server
- Does **not** use cookies
- Uses `localStorage` only for spam prevention (rate limiting)
- Does **not** include any analytics or tracking scripts
- Submissions are sent to Formspree and forwarded to your email
